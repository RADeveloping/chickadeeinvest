## Remote Environment Setup

Use the following instructions to deploy the project to one of the two available remote environments on Azure - `dev` and `dev2` as of 11/18/2022:

1. Go to the CI action for your commit. Depending on which branch you are on, you can find it in different places.
   1. If you are on the `main` or `develop` branch
      1. Click on the build status indicator next to the commit hash.

      2. Find the CI job in the pop-up.
   2. If you are on your feature branch
      1. Open a pull request with either `develop` (recommended) or `main` as the base branch.
      2. Find the CI job at the bottom of your pull request. From now on, every commit you push to your branch will trigger a build action to run as a CI job.

4. Near the end of the output, copy the image tag after the message "Successfully tagged" e.g. `chickadeeinvest/chickadee:1667885238`. You will be deploying this specific image to a remote environment soon.

5. Sign in to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
6. Go to the Azure App Service resource for the environment to which you would like to deploy the image. You may want to double-check with your team to ensure the environment is not in use by someone.

8. In **Registry settings/Config**, replace the image tag at `services.chickadee.image` with the one you copied in step 4. You may want to choose a new **Configuration File** if it was changed since the last deployment.

# ASP.NET MVC

## Layout File

The ```Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Manage/_Layout.cshtml``` file is the starting point of all ASP.NET pages.

This file contains the main container and then rendering each of the other pages using ``` @RenderBody()```.

## Profile Page View ASP.NET

Anything related to the user profile, including changing password, email, etc are in the ```Areas/Identity/Pages/Account``` directory.

Each page has a ```.cshtml``` file and a corresponding ```.cshtml.cs``` file. 

<i>For the most part, in this directory, you shouldn't really need to go inside the ```.cshtml.cs``` file.</i>

## SuperAdmin View ASP.NET

The controllers are in the ```/Controllers``` directory
The views are in the ```/Views``` directory.
The models are in the ```/Models``` directory.

This structure must be maintained. If the structure is modified, then the api mapping must also be changed to reflect the changes.

The controllers for the SuperAdmin are prefixed with "SA" followed by the page name.

For example:  ```SACompanyController```

For each controller there is also a accompanying model in the ```/Models``` directory.

To make changes the views, simply go to ```/View/{ControllerName}``` directory and select the corresponding .cshtml file you would like to edit.

The pages use bootstrap, so updating them should be fairly simple.

For more information regarding how boostrap works, you can visit the official [boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) website..

The [bootstrap-table](https://bootstrap-table.com/) is being being used for the index pages and is highly customizable as well.

The SuperAdmin is not using the same API the front end is using. Therefore if the front end goes down, the SuperAdmin would still have access to the back end to make any changes.

There is too much to explain regarding the MVC in ASP.NET that wouldn't be beneficial to include here, however Microsoft's [Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/controller-methods-views?view=aspnetcore-6.0) is a great resource to refer to.

## Navigation Menu

The navigation menu for the ASP.NET side is included in the ```/Areas/Identity/Pages/``` directory, inside ```_ManageNav.cshtml``` 

## Improvements

 - ASP.NET "partials" can be used to reduce the amount of code between the pages since most pages have similar content.
 - Depending on what the client wants, fields can be added or removed from each of the individual pages.
